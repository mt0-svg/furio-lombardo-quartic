# Adic completeness of finite products

For an ideal `I` of a commutative ring `R` and a family of `R`-modules `M i`, the product `∀ i, M i`
is `I`-adically Hausdorff as soon as every factor is. If the family is finite, the analogous result
holds for adic precompleteness and completeness. In particular a finite free module `Fin n → R`
over an `I`-adically complete ring is `I`-adically complete, which is what the complete Nakayama
lemma (`surjective_of_mkQ_comp_surjective`) requires of the source of a map out of a finite free
module.

## Main results

* `AdicCompletion.pi_of`: the product of the completions of the factors receives the canonical
  map from the product as the product of the canonical maps.
* `IsHausdorff.pi`: adic Hausdorffness passes to products.
* `IsPrecomplete.pi`, `IsAdicComplete.pi`: adic precompleteness and completeness pass to finite
  products.
