# Henselian rings

This file gathers the basic consequences of Henselianity that Mathlib does not provide.

Mathlib has both halves of the comparison between `HenselianRing R I`, which lifts a simple root
over `R ⧸ I`, and `HenselianLocalRing R`, which lifts a simple root over the residue field, except
for the step that produces the local class from the ideal-theoretic one at `I = 𝔪`. So
`IsAdicComplete.henselianRing` never reaches `HenselianLocalRing`, and the Henselian API is
unavailable for a complete local ring such as the integers of a complete discretely valued field.

The step is short: the two differ only in their simplicity hypothesis, `IsUnit (f' a₀)` against
`IsUnit (Ideal.Quotient.mk 𝔪 (f' a₀))`, and over a local ring a unit maps to a unit.

The second half of the file extracts roots. Let `R` be a ring that is Henselian at an ideal `J`,
and let `n` be a natural number that is invertible in `R`. Then every element `w` congruent to `1`
modulo an ideal `I ≤ J` has an `n`-th root that is itself congruent to `1` modulo `I`.

This is the standard source of `n`-th roots of principal units away from the residue
characteristic: over the integer ring of a local field it shows that each positive-depth step of
the unit filtration is carried onto itself by the `n`-th power map.

Without assuming `2` invertible, every element of `1 + 4J` is a square. This supplies deep
square roots in residue characteristic two, by solving `t² + t = c` for `c ∈ J`.

## Main results

* `FurioLombardo.Vendor.Toolbox.TauCeti.HenselianRing.henselianLocalRing`: a local ring that is Henselian at its maximal ideal
  is a Henselian local ring.
* `FurioLombardo.Vendor.Toolbox.TauCeti.IsAdicComplete.henselianLocalRing`: a local ring that is complete for the adic topology
  of its maximal ideal is a Henselian local ring.
* `FurioLombardo.Vendor.Toolbox.TauCeti.HenselianLocalRing.exists_pow_eq_of_residue_pow_eq`: a simple power root in the
  residue field lifts to a root with the same residue.
* `FurioLombardo.Vendor.Toolbox.TauCeti.HenselianRing.exists_pow_eq_and_sub_one_mem_of_sub_one_mem`: if `n` is invertible,
  `I ≤ J` and `w ≡ 1 mod I`, then `w = a ^ n` for some `a ≡ 1 mod I`.

## Implementation notes

Hensel's lemma applied to `X ^ n - w` at the approximate root `1` produces a root `a` with
`a ≡ 1` modulo `J` only. The congruence is then sharpened to `I` through the factorization
`a ^ n - 1 = (1 + a + ⋯ + a ^ (n - 1)) * (a - 1)`, whose first factor reduces to `n` modulo `J`
and is therefore a unit, `J` lying in the Jacobson radical.

/-- A local ring that is Henselian at its maximal ideal is a Henselian local ring. The two
hypotheses differ only in their simplicity condition, which asks the derivative to be a unit in the
residue field rather than in the ring, and over a local ring the image of a unit is a unit.

This is not an instance: Mathlib already registers the converse implication as one, so the pair
would form an instance cycle. -/
