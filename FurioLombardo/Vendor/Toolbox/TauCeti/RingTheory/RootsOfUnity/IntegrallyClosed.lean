# Roots of unity do not leave an integrally closed subring

If `R` is integrally closed in `A`, then `R` and `A` have the same `n`-th roots of unity for every
`n ≠ 0`: an `n`-th root of unity `x` of `A` satisfies `x ^ n = 1`, so it is integral over `R` and
therefore comes from `R`, and its inverse `x ^ (n - 1)` comes from `R` as well.

The typical use is `R` a valuation ring and `A` its fraction field, where it says that all roots of
unity of the field are already units of the valuation ring.

## Main results

* `FurioLombardo.Vendor.Toolbox.TauCeti.restrictRootsOfUnity_bijective`: the inclusion `R → A` induces a bijection on
  `n`-th roots of unity.
* `FurioLombardo.Vendor.Toolbox.TauCeti.rootsOfUnityMulEquiv`: the inclusion `R → A` restricts to an
  isomorphism `μ_n(R) ≃* μ_n(A)`.

/-- If `R` is integrally closed in `A` and `n ≠ 0`, restricting the inclusion `R → A` to `n`-th
roots of unity is a bijection: it is injective because `R → A` is, and surjective because an
`n`-th root of unity of `A` is integral over `R`, hence comes from `R`. -/
