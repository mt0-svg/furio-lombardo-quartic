# The completed Dedekind zeta function, by characterisation  (SP1-FE interface)

Mathlib's `NumberField.dedekindZeta` is the `L`-series only — genuine (an honest convergent
sum) exactly on the half-plane `Re s > 1` and junk elsewhere. The completed zeta
`Λ_K(s) = |Δ_K|^{s/2}·Γℝ(s)^{r₁}·Γℂ(s)^{r₂}·ζ_K(s)` therefore cannot be *defined* through it
on all of `ℂ` without lying in the critical strip.

Instead we **characterise** it, with no placeholder anywhere:

* `completedZetaPrefactor K s = |Δ_K|^{s/2}·γ_K(s)` — genuine (a `cpow` and Gamma factors);
* `IsCompletedDedekindZeta K Λ` — `Λ` agrees with `completedZetaPrefactor · ζ_K` on
  `Re s > 1` **and** `s(s-1)Λ(s)` is entire.

By the identity theorem the two conditions determine `Λ` **uniquely**
(`IsCompletedDedekindZeta.unique`), so quantifying over `Λ` with this predicate *is*
talking about "the" completed Dedekind zeta. Hecke's theorem — the target of SP1-AGE —
is the **existence** statement (construct `Λ` as a Mellin transform of the ideal-class
theta integrals); the functional equation `Λ(1-s) = Λ(s)` is proven of that construction.

This interface is what the GRH predicate (`GRH.lean`) and Theorem 1 consume; nothing here
is a stub.

/-- **Characterisation of the completed Dedekind zeta function** `Λ_K`:
1. on the half-plane of absolute convergence `Re s > 1` (where mathlib's `dedekindZeta`
   is the honest convergent `L`-series), `Λ` is `|Δ_K|^{s/2}·γ_K(s)·ζ_K(s)`;
2. `s(s-1)·Λ(s)` extends to an entire function — `Λ` is analytic away from (at most
   simple) poles at `s = 0, 1`.

Note the *extends* in 2: a total function `Λ : ℂ → ℂ` carrying genuine poles stores junk
values at `0` and `1`, so `s(s-1)·Λ(s)` literally vanishes there while its analytic
continuation does not; the faithful rendering of "`s(s-1)Λ_K(s)` is entire" is the
existence of an entire `H` agreeing with it away from the two poles.

These two conditions determine `Λ` uniquely away from the poles
(`IsCompletedDedekindZeta.eqOn`): this predicate **is** "the" completed Dedekind zeta,
stated without first constructing the meromorphic continuation. Hecke's theorem
(`exists_isCompletedDedekindZeta`: existence of such a `Λ` via the theta-Mellin
construction) is what makes the predicate inhabited. -/

    ∧ ∃ H : ℂ → ℂ, Differentiable ℂ H
        ∧ ∀ s : ℂ, s ≠ 0 → s ≠ 1 → H s = s * (s - 1) * Λ s

/-- **Uniqueness.** Any two functions satisfying the completed-zeta characterisation agree
away from the poles `s = 0, 1`: the entire functions `s(s-1)Λᵢ(s)` agree on the open
half-plane `Re s > 1`, hence everywhere by the identity theorem; cancel `s(s-1)`.
(No condition can pin the values *at* `0` and `1` — the genuine `Λ_K` has simple poles
there, so those values are junk by nature.) -/
